Add grammar for the following:

* Reflect methods
* RegExp objects
* String objects
* WeakMap objects
* WeakSet objects
* eval
* Date objects
* Intl methods

Other TODOs:

* Try figure out how to get Heapsort (in `VM/JSLib/Sorting.h`) to get called
* Maybe add a patch to hermes to allow for GC calls somehow?
* Port the fuzzer over to rust later (MAYBE)
