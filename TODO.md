Add grammar for the following:

* JSProxy
* Make RegExp expressions semantically correct (kinda hard...)
* String objects (ensure to cover UTF-16 strings)
* eval
* Date objects
* Intl methods
* JSFunctions
* Reflect apply() and construct() after functions are implemented

Other TODOs:

* Try figure out how to get Heapsort (in `VM/JSLib/Sorting.h`) to get called
* Maybe add a patch to hermes to allow for GC calls somehow?
* Port the fuzzer over to rust later (MAYBE)
